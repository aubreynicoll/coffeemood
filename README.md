## Motivation
I've been a fan of rainymood.com for quite some time, and while taking Dr. Barbara Oakley's fantastic Mindshift course, she mentioned that the sounds of a bustling caf√© can actually help creative thinking. I thought this was interesting, and I decided to make an app for this purpose.

While the app itself is quite simple, I'm taking the opportunity to explore a few new technologies with this project, namely Webpack and React Native.

## Technologies Used

* React
* Node
* Express
* CSS
* Webpack
* [React Native](https://github.com/aubreynicoll/coffeemood-native)

## Features
Science has shown that small distractions, such as those that might occur in a busy cafeteria, can help enable diffuse thought patterns. This app helps simulate that environment by providing recorded audio.
